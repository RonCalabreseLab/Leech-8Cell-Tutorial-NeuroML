 	 In cartesian coordinates, the format for each compartment parameter line
    in a cell parameter file is
    
        name parent x y z dia chan dens [chan dens] ...  

    For polar coordinates, it is

        name parent r theta phi dia chan dens [chan dens] ...

    Here, 'name' gives the name of the compartment, and 'parent' refers to the
    adjacent compartment to which it is connected.  'parent' may be replaced
    by '.' to refer to the compartment defined on the preceding line.  For
    asymmetric compartments, the connection to 'parent' is through the axial
    resistance (Ra) of 'name'.  The coordinates and diameter (x, y, z, dia)
    are in microns, all other units are SI (Meter, Kg, Second, Ampere).  In
    polar mode 'r' is in microns, theta and phi in degrees.  Theta is measured
    from the z-axis and phi from the x-axis in the x-y plane.  The compartment
    length, which is not stated explicitly, is calculated from the coodinates
    of the compartment and its parent.

    'chan' is the name of one of the channel prototypes under the neutral
    element '/library'.  At present, the supported channel types are
    hh_channel, tabchannel, tab2Dchannel, tabcurrent, vdep_channel, synchan,
    hebbsynchan, ddsyn, receptor2, manuelconduct, and graded.  'chan' may also
    refer to the other neural element types:  spikegen, Ca_concen, difshell,
    difbuffer, concpool, mmpump, and hillpump.  Presently, the obsolete
    channelC, channelC2, channelC3, and spike objects are also supported.

    For channels, 'dens' is the conductance density (Gbar or gmax per unit
    compartment area) in Siemens/m^2.  If a negative value is specified, the
    absolute value is taken, and it is interpreted as the maximum
    conductance in Siemens, without scaling by the compartment area.

    For spikegen elements, the 'dens' parameter is the 'thresh' field of the
    element.  For Ca_concen elements, it is the 'B' field, divided by the
    volume of the compartment.  However, if the 'thick' field of the Ca_concen
    element is non-zero, the volume is scaled using the volume of a true shell
    of thickness 'thick'.  A negative value of 'dens' is used to indicate that
    it should be taken as an absolute value of B, without scaling.

    A maximum of 30 'chan dens' pairs are allowed in a compartment
    specification.  The '*compt' option described below provides a way to
    overcome this limitation.

    Several types of options may be specified in the cell parameter file.
    These options start with a '*', and affect all lines following them,
    until canceled by the opposite command.

PARAMETER VALUES

    *set_compt_param variable value

        sets one of the following internal variables used by the cell
        reader to 'value'.  'value' may be a number, or the name of a
        globally defined script variable.

        RM            specific membrane resistance in ohm*m^2
        RA            specific axial resistance in ohm*m
        CM            specific membrane capacitance in farad/m^2
        EREST_ACT     resting potential in volts (initial Em and initVm)
        ELEAK         if specified, gives an alternate value for initial Em,
                      so that Vm will be initialized to initVm (EREST_ACT)
                      on reset, instead of Em.  Otherwise, ELEAK = EREST_ACT.
