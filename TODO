- Netbeans does XSL checking
- use projection instead of connection?
- use jnml -graph, -graph3 (using latest version)
- OSB tutorials; needs account (Padraid will give an access code
  for easy registration)
- biorxiv paper on OSB, under review in Neuron. Has figures on tutorial;
  there's some docs and they can help
- simulations still submitted to AWS or NSG, but one getting stuck can get it delayed
- return pretty fast, Padraig can create special hardware for class on certain dates
- blockingPlasticSynapse -> has sub component that modulates output voltageConcDep (in Synapse.xml, example #6 NMDA)
- analogSynapse has access to voltages (Vpeer), but I need to detect the spikes (OnCondition or OnEvent)
- create plotting all synaptic values to test this!

+ jnml crash state dump shows broken components
+ add the m gate inside the analogsynapse (test it separately first)
+ merge LR cells into same file and add them into separate populations
