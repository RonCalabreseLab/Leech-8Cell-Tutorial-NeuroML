- blockingPlasticSynapse -> has sub component that modulates output voltageConcDep (in Synapse.xml, example #6 NMDA)
- analogSynapse has access to voltages (Vpeer), but I need to detect the spikes (OnCondition or OnEvent)
- create plotting all synaptic values to test this!

+ jnml crash state dump shows broken components
+ add the m gate inside the analogsynapse (test it separately first)
+ merge LR cells into same file and add them into separate populations
